My name is Jordan Vasquez. I am a high school senior from Sacramento, as well as a youth advocate at the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders based at the Harvard School of Public Health. I would like to share my experiences with witnessing first hand the consequences of diet pills on the mental health of my close friends and my peers as well as express my strong support for Assembly Bill 82, which would ban the sale of deceptive over-the-counter diet pills and weight-loss supplements to minors. 

In our society,  the pressure to conform to body image ideals is overwhelming, especially for teenagers. Throughout middle school and early high school, I, too, struggled with accepting my body. As a result of my weight, I grappled with my own mental health issues, and tried hard to change who I was in the pursuit of acceptance by my peers. Many of my peers also faced self-esteem issues, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which only exacerbated these problems. In recent years, the rise of toxic gym culture and social media have increased in prevalence, only feeding into harmful beauty ideals. Children are convinced that they need to achieve an unattainable body and often turn to the deceptive claims touted by weight-loss supplement companies. Paired with the promotion of strict diet plans, children ultimately develop poor mental health and body image issues. It is heartbreaking to see some of my close friends skipping meals on a daily basis and consuming diet pills in order to attain this, not knowing the consequences it has on them. At several points, I considered taking supplements so I could achieve a so-called “better body”, and at times, my peers, who were unaware of potential risks, even encouraged me to take dietary supplements. 

This is a similar story for millions of Californian youth who lack this vital knowledge and as a result turn to diet pills in hopes of quickly achieving a certain body type. These are the children who urgently need protection from the deceptive weight-loss industry. AB 82 is crucial to shield the youth of California from these dangerous diet pills and weight-loss supplements, by preventing these companies from profiting off of and exploiting the insecurities of children. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I hope that my efforts will inspire further action to keep diet pills out of kids’ hands, and I urge you to vote in favor of AB-82.
