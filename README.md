**Legislative Simulacrum** is an open-source tool that enables community advocates to talk, lobby, and practice advocacy with virtual lawmaker agents. 
Our tool simulates multi-turn conversation, multimodal (e.g. audio + visual) interactions of lawmakers from US about a wide variety of public policy 
and public health issues. Community advocates can specify the virtual lawmakers' political ideology, demographic details, and conversation settings 
which can be one-to-one deliberations or hearings. 

Our tool empowers and encourages community advocates to engage with democratic processes by lowering the barrier and providing a stepping-stone experience.
